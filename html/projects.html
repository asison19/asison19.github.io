                            This program reads an input or text file, tokenizes it and checks for proper syntax
                            according to the lexical and syntax conventions of the Toy programming language.

                            Together with my teammate we worked on this for our Compilers and Interpreters course,
                            probably my most favorite course while attending Cal Poly Pomona. The things we learned in
                            that course I still use directly and indirectly to this day.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            On this project, I worked on both the scanner, parser, and trie table. I used both
                            <a href="https://jflex.de/" target="_blank">JFlex</a>
                            and
                            <a href="http://www2.cs.tum.edu/projects/cup/" target="_blank">CUP</a>
                            to create the scanner and parser respectively. I also resolved grammar conflicts such as
                            shift-reduce and reduce-reduce conflicts by rewriting the grammar so that the conflicts
                            never
                            occurs. I even taught my teammate how to use Git and GitHub so that we could more easily
                            work
                            on the program together.

                            This program was used to make graphs of Particulate Matter (PM) of Cal Poly Pomona and other
                            cities in California as comparisons. Using public
                            <a href="https://www2.purpleair.com/" target="_blank">Purple Air</a>
                            sensors, I was able to extract it's data containing PM levels, temperature, humidity, etc.
                            and
                            graph them with relation to time.

                            Below is an example of one of the graphs.

                            Two players on an 8x8 board, each player can move like a queen in chess, spaces that each
                            player moves to become occupied and become a sort of barrier, goal is to isolate your
                            opponent to the point that they have no more available moves.

                            My friend <a href="https://github.com/clovenski" target="_blank">Joel</a> and I wanted to
                            work
                            on something
                            together and after awhile we thought of this game. He had previously created the AI for one
                            of his classes and we thought it'd be cool for it to have a UI.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I did most of the implemenation using <a href="https://www.qt.io/" target="_blank">Qt</a>,
                            and
                            Joel did more
                            finishing touches on the AI. I wanted the player to understand it easily from just playing
                            it
                            without having to rely on a tutorial, hints, tips etc. I made the controls click-and-drag
                            and
                            had viable positions for them to move onto have a visual indicator.
