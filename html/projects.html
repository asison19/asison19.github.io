                        <p>
                            I've designed a language that can be used as a food diary to help users watch their overall health. The goal of this project is to turn any input of the language, like a food diary and eventually a http request, into a csv that could then be used to visualize and graph a user's food intake. The idea is to show the user the amount of foods they eat, the nutrition, and eventually more. Other than food intake, other goals for the interpreter include food output, sleep, and exercise.

                            Two players start on an 8x8 board, and each player can move spaces like they would a queen in chess. The spaces that each player moves to become occupied, can't be moved to anymore, and become a barrier when left. The goal is to isolate your opponent to the point that they have no more available moves.

                            I implemented the GUI using C++ and <a href="https://www.qt.io/" target="_blank">Qt</a>, and my friend did more finishing touches on the AI. I wanted the player to understand it easily from just playing it without having to rely on a tutorial, hints, tips etc. I made the controls click-and-drag and had viable positions for them to move onto have a visual indicator.

                            This program reads an input or text file, tokenizes it and checks for proper syntax
                            according to the lexical and syntax conventions of the Toy programming language.

                            Together with my teammate we worked on this for our Compilers and Interpreters course,
                            probably my most favorite course while attending Cal Poly Pomona. The things we learned in
                            that course I still use directly and indirectly to this day.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            On this project, I worked on both the scanner, parser, and trie table. I used both
                            <a href="https://jflex.de/" target="_blank">JFlex</a>
                            and
                            <a href="http://www2.cs.tum.edu/projects/cup/" target="_blank">CUP</a>
                            to create the scanner and parser respectively. I also resolved grammar conflicts such as
                            shift-reduce and reduce-reduce conflicts by rewriting the grammar so that the conflicts
                            never
                            occurs. I even taught my teammate how to use Git and GitHub so that we could more easily
                            work
                            on the program together.

                            This program was used to make graphs of Particulate Matter (PM) of Cal Poly Pomona and other
                            cities in California as comparisons. Using public

                            sensors, I was able to extract it's data containing PM levels, temperature, humidity, etc.
                            and
                            graph them with relation to time.
